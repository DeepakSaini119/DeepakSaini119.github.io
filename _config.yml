title_description: "Hi there! I am Deepak Saini. I am a Research Engineer at Microsoft Research where I work on large scale recommendation problems. My work has an intersection between machine learning and efficient system design. I work on developing and deploying Extreme Classification (XC) algorithms with guidance from <a href='http://manikvarma.org/'>Manik Varma</a>. Algorithms developed by me are deployed on Bing and MSN where they are helping billions of users and (in-process) generate millions of dollars in revenue by showing more relevant and presonalized recommendations. <br> Before joining MSR, I worked as AI Engineer in Zomato to determine the best personalized ordering of restaurants for users on the App home page. I obtained a dual-degree(B.Tech + M.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href='https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/'>IIT Delhi</a> in 2018"
